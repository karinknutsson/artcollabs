ARTCOLLABS was createdy by Karin Knutsson, Felix Worringen, and Jean Michel Battirola as their final project for the Le Wagon web developer bootcamp in 2021. The idea is to build a community for artists and other creatives to meet, collaborate and organize projects together. It makes it easy for anyone to create a project, upload images, set milestones and chat with the other project participants. You can search for projects using keywords or tags, request to join and find all your current projects and collaborations in a comprehensive dashboard. 

The project is currently maintained by Karin Knutsson, who is working on a redesign, fixing bugs and planning to implement contacts and a direct messaging system.
