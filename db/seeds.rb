In between and at times, gh93 has been rented out or utilized for other purposes: Atellier, Recording Studio, Fashion Showroom, Photography Studio, Mini Theater, Performance Venue, Event Bar, Jewelery Store and other artistic art, craft or creative endeavors.
                   Today gh93 is the private music, technical and artistic atelier from AAtics. And at times inviting other musicians, producers, artists, curators, technologists, architects and philosophers for private high level interactions for future presentations..

The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. With Plato‚Äôs allegory of the cave in mind, they try to increase the dynamic between audience and author by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations. Their works are an investigation into representations of (seemingly) concrete ages and situations as well as depictions and ideas that can only be realized in art."

transgression = Project.new(title: "TRANSGRESSION", description: "Our sponsor, the Worcester Art Museum (WAM), is largely involved with art from the past and exhibiting example of historical periods of art. However, in the near future they will be sponsoring a new exhibit, called Reusable Universes, that will feature artwork created by the contemporary artist, Shih Chieh Huang. This new exhibit will need corresponding interactive activities, provided by the WAM, to allow visitors to become more involved. Huang takes inspiration from early technology such as computer cooling fans, basic circuit boards, and even simpler objects; such as power strips, in order to create his sculptures. His views of these everyday objects differ from those of the public and our understanding of his creative process can only be developed so far through text. In order for viewers to truly grasp the thoughts and concepts that go into his work, Huang has set out to bring his artistic process to life and put on a show featuring himself creating one of his sculptures. He plans to highlight the meaning of each object through the location and orientation he chooses as the audience observes how he brings his art to life. Working alongside the WAM, Huang will be able to give the audience enough information and examples of his work to develop a true appreciation of his art style.",

future = Project.new(title: "Future Spaces of Cohabitation",

The theme ‚ÄòLandscapes of care‚Äô focuses on a change of direction in the values, interests and priorities that drive architecture and urban planning. The main focus changes from the individual actor or the individual object, towards a greater sensitivity to issues of interconnection, attachment and interdependence. Questions about how we live well together peacefully in diversity and with respect for each other's differences are pressing on in several contexts. Inequality manifests in physical spaces as it‚Äôs not the same to be locked down in minimum space housing than in open residential spaces. In the same line, at urban scale in vulnerable public housing areas residents must vacate their communal areas on the basis of criteria to which privately owned residential areas and their residents are not subjected. Other examples are the existing zoning ban for homeless and other marginalized street residents, proposed zoning bans for ‚Äòinsecurity-creating‚Äô stays in public spaces linked to gender and ethnicity, the design and regulation of camps for refugees and asylum seekers, etc. The community and its spatial expression have been put up for debate these years. Can architecture and urban development contribute concretely to facilitate safe mobility and equality in urban space? How can architecture and urban planning support people in precarious life situations and provide space for minorities? How do we take care of creating a safe, open city and inclusive public spaces at a time when many (new voices) express that they feel underrepresented and discriminated against every day, e.g. in the institutions' structures, public spaces and discourses about affiliation, homes, norms of behavior and policies?"

People are at once a celebrated and reviled pastime. From humble beginnings as a vandal‚Äôs crime in New York City, street art has evolved to become globally accepted. Artists like Shepard Fairey and JR have seen their work attract attention in political campaigns and high society. However, art can still be considered vandalism in many cases in the U.S. and around the world. This was proven in last year‚Äôs destruction of the iconic 5 Pointz in Queens. The street art initiative by Shanaya provides a safe haven for these masterfully creative works. One of the most important features is that the people are shown in their natural habitat, so the viewer can truly understand the space the art creates (quite an improvement over putting a Banksy piece in an auction). Not only does Shanaya's project preserve  art for time immemorial, but it provides a window into another world of art spanning the entire globe."

little_frank = Project.new(title: "Little Frank Studies", description: "Fraser was born in Billings, Montana and grew up in Berkeley, California. She attended New York University, the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program, and the School of Visual Arts. Fraser worked as a gallery attendant at Dia:Chelsea. Fraser began writing art criticism before incorporating a similar analysis into her artistic practice. Her videotape performance Little Frank and His Carp (2001), shot with five hidden cameras in the atrium of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, targets architectural dominance of modern gallery spaces. Using the original soundtrack of an acoustic guide at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, she '... writhes with pleasure as the recorded voice draws attention to the undulating curves and textured surfaces of the surrounding space' which she takes literally in an 'erotic encounter'. Fraser's sexual display towards the architecture reveals the irony of the erotic words used on the audio tour to describe the museum's structure. The plan is to analyze the content of the architectural pieces used by Fraser and gather our own views on her project in order to reproduce the concept in a Virtual Ambient",

Combining unrelated aspects lead to surprising analogies. By manipulating the viewer to create confusion, we often create several practically identical works, upon which thoughts that have apparently just been developed are manifested: notes are made and then crossed out again, ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô are repeated. Our works question the conditions of appearance of an image in the context of contemporary visual culture in which images, representations and ideas normally function. By experimenting with aleatoric processes, we formalize the coincidental and emphasizes the conscious process of composition that is behind the seemingly random works. The thought processes, which are supposedly private, highly subjective and unfiltered in their references to dream worlds, are frequently revealed as assemblages. Our works are on the one hand touchingly beautiful, on the other hand painfully attractive. Again and again, the artists leave us orphaned with a mix of conflicting feelings and thoughts.")

Not only were we struck by the morbid, isolating restrictions of lockdown, but we faced increasing global violence (particularly against trans people of colour), transphobic tirades, and the implementation of devastating policy by Liz Truss. Now, against the advice of healthcare professionals, court orders have halted puberty blockers being given out at The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (the London-based Gender Identity Development Service), thereby restricting the access of these drugs to under-16 trans youths. Amid this backdrop of hostility, violence, prejudice, and isolation a group of artists came together during lockdown to resiliently forge a creative trans community. Trans healthcare charity We Exist teamed up with artist studio initiative The Koppel Project to facilitate an artist residency exclusively for trans and non-binary folk. Running from November 2020 to the end of January 2021, the residency provided studio space for 30 creatives in the heart of London. The space was open to trans artists of all creative backgrounds, from dancers and designers to writers and sculptors, covering a wide diversity of gender expressions and identities. The residency takes place at the abandoned, old campus of Central Saint Martins, a building which birthed such legends as Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Kane. Taking it over in 2016 in order to provide affordable studio spaces and teaching for artists, The Koppel Project's intention is creating 'a safe, inclusive community for artistic expression and a platform for all emerging makers.' Whist adhering to social distancing, the space remained open over lockdown, giving these artists a creative haven to make, scavenge, and destroy before the campus‚Äô renovation starts this February."

This also gives us the opportunity to re-establish the gallery‚Äôs core directives: to remain a consistent and active member of the local community, while considering community health and safety. To this end, Auction 6 will assume a de-centralised format to become the second auction in which the bidding takes place online.

The community-oriented programme of winkelhalle emphasises connection and conviviality, with an intention to generate community networks of artist support and neighbourhood engagement. By taking this localised approach, we aim to raise funds to enable both our gallery and the artists we support to continue producing their respective work, while also maintaining a significant connection to the surrounding neighbourhood. We intend to preserve this community building initiative as central to our curatorial programme, using the online auction format to expand the reach of the gallery for the benefit of the artists we support. Additionally, in order to make art accessible to a wide range of visitors, artworks will be priced at a scale of affordability. ")

                    Enter South South Veza, a novel sales platform that centers the Global South. Part auction, part online fair, the new model hopes to bring momentum to corners of the market that have been neglected during the pandemic. The platform debuted on February 23 with a live, 22-lot auction and a 49-lot timed online auction, which kicked off a week of online viewing rooms.
                    The hybrid format is being introduced amid a wider blurring of the boundaries between the traditional territories of galleries and auction houses, as private sales become more important for the main houses, and the demand for ultra-contemporary work continues to soar.")

The concept: Originating in philosophical and scientific writings, sensibility became an English-language literary movement, particularly in the then-new genre of the novel. Such works, called sentimental novels, featured individuals who were prone to sensibility, often weeping, fainting, feeling weak, or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience. If one were especially sensible, one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others. This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible person's ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them. However, the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash, as anti-sensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics, and such an emphasis on one's own feelings and reactions a sign of narcissism. Samuel Johnson, in his portrait of Miss Gentle, articulated this criticism: She daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain, and another be frighted by the high wind. Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets, and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates. Sentimentalism asserted that over-shown feeling was not a weakness but rather showed one to be a moral person. Arising from religiously motivated empathy, it expanded to the other perceptions‚Äîfor example, sensual love was no longer understood as a destructive passion (Vanitas) but rather as a basis of social institutions, as it was for Antoine Houdar de la Motte. Requited love was, as in serious opera (the Trag√©die en musique or Opera seria), a symbol for a successful alliance between nations. The 'Lesesucht' re-evaluated what was permitted literature, and the novel as a type of literature as versus drama.",

                         description: "The exhibition invites 100 Berlin-based artists to come into an empty gallery space and their presence becomes part of the work. It aims to go beyond the usual bound that separates the artist and the performer from the public, and invite the public to participate in the artist‚Äôs experience and to the artist‚Äôs point of view.
                         As a response to Institut f√ºr Alles M√∂gliche, Take Place ‚Ö† fills the 20 square meter gallery space with artists. Presented through the window wall towards the street, the work consists of live encounters between people, while the material is the artists or the artists‚Äô presence. During the opening hour, street passengers and visitors are welcome to come into the gallery. Once they enter the gallery, the audiences become parts of the work. With artists standing, sitting and chatting in the space, the work erases the difference between the artists and visitors, and questions the general expectations towards an exhibition. It exists as a performance, an interaction, and an immaterial experience.
                         In Take Place ‚Ö†‚Ö†, a group of artists sit on three rows of stadium seats inside the gallery facing the window, and stare at the street through the entire opening hours. Rather than being observed, the work is observing whatever is happening outside the gallery and creating an unfamiliar situation for both the artists and the viewers. And the work itself is held in the moments of these encounters. Through these encounters, the work challenges the viewers‚Äô as well as the artists‚Äô roles and participations in a work and in an exhibition, blurring the lines between the making, presenting, and experiencing of an art piece.")
