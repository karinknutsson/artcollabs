Since the winter of 2012, the space and community has developed and morphed with the same goals in mind. ‚ÄúPushing magnetism, thought and enjoyment to and through people via art, positive social interaction and music. Along with the realization of tools and technical platform for related aesthetics, interaction and commerce.

Previously GH36 has mostly been utilized  as a modern art Gallery and experiencing different curators, gallerists, artists of all mediums and students. In between and at times, GH36 has been rented out or utilized for other purposes: Atellier, Recording Studio, Fashion Showroom, Photography Studio, Mini Theater, Performance Venue, Event Bar, Jewelery Store and other artistic art, craft or creative endeavors.

Today GH36 is the private music, technical and artistic atelier from AAtics. And at times inviting other musicians, producers, artists, curators, technologists, architects and philosophers for private high level interactions for future presentations..

GH36 is located in Berlin Mitte, in the heart of the art district on the Grosse Hamburger Str.

We hope to look forward to communicating with you personally.")

The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. With Plato‚Äôs allegory of the cave in mind, they try to increase the dynamic between audience and author by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations.

transgression = Project.new(title: "TRANSGRESSION", description: "Our sponsor, the Worcester Art Museum (WAM), is largely involved with art from the past and exhibiting example of historical periods of art. However, in the near future they will be sponsoring a new exhibit, called Reusable Universes, that will feature artwork created by the contemporary artist, Shih Chieh Huang. This new exhibit will need corresponding interactive activities, provided by the WAM, to allow visitors to become more involved. Huang takes inspiration from early technology such as computer cooling fans, basic circuit boards, and even simpler objects; such as power strips, in order to create his sculptures. His views of these everyday objects differ from those of the public and our understanding of his creative process can only be developed so far through text. In order for viewers to truly grasp the thoughts and concepts that go into his work, Huang has set out to bring his artistic process to life and put on a show featuring himself creating one of his sculptures. He plans to highlight the meaning of each object through the location and orientation he chooses as the audience observes how he brings his art to life. Working alongside the WAM, Huang will be able to give the audience enough information and examples of his work to develop a true appreciation of his art style.",

intacto = Project.new(title: "Intacto", description: "Designers, architects and urban planners are increasingly taking on the task of managing social and political issues of relationships, neighborhoods, energy flows, mobility, cultural heritage, identity and urban change, rather than just spatial and formal aspects. The theme ‚ÄòLandscapes of care‚Äô focuses on a change of direction in the values, interests and priorities that drive architecture and urban planning. The main focus changes from the individual actor or the individual object, towards a greater sensitivity to issues of interconnection, attachment and interdependence.
Diversity, equity and community

Questions about how we live well together peacefully in diversity and with respect for each other's differences are pressing on in several contexts. Inequality manifests in physical spaces as it‚Äôs not the same to be locked down in minimum space housing than in open residential spaces. In the same line, at urban scale in vulnerable public housing areas residents must vacate their communal areas on the basis of criteria to which privately owned residential areas and their residents are not subjected. Other examples are the existing zoning ban for homeless and other marginalized street residents, proposed zoning bans for ‚Äòinsecurity-creating‚Äô stays in public spaces linked to gender and ethnicity, the design and regulation of camps for refugees and asylum seekers, etc. The community and its spatial expression have been put up for debate these years. Can architecture and urban development contribute concretely to facilitate safe mobility and equality in urban space? How can architecture and urban planning support people in precarious life situations and provide space for minorities? How do we take care of creating a safe, open city and inclusive public spaces at a time when many (new voices) express that they feel underrepresented and discriminated against every day, e.g. in the institutions' structures, public spaces and discourses about affiliation, homes, norms of behavior and policies?

Architecture as a climatic care provider?

Architecture and urbanism are responsible for some of the worst carbon monoxide emissions. Cement alone, one of the most widely used materials in construction nowadays, is the source of about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions[2]. How much care do urban planners, architects and landscape architects take to plan for future generations? How does the profession and decision makers show responsibility for achieving the goal of CO2-neutral cities? How do we, as homo sapiens, a species that significantly affects world evolution, take into account the other species with which we share the planet? In the so-called Anthropocene age, the common resources must be understood as elements that do not only belong to humans, therefore we might challenge familiar notions of species hierarchies. Although many conservation initiatives come for Western countries claiming to support biodiversity and nature conservation, the very nature of capitalism keeps us being the main resource consumers worldwide.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has has boostered or provoked new initiatives: In December 2019 the EU has launched a European Green Deal with the goal of making Europa climate neutral by 2050[3]. At the same time, a new report from the C40 network of major cities around the world shows that green investment linked to post-pandemic reconstruction of societies can create significant economic, social and environmental gains[4]. Yet only 3-5% of global funds are earmarked for sustainable investment. How can we turn the tide? How does consideration for the well-being of our common resources affect the role of the architect and the ethics of the architectural profession? How do the management of our common resources such as clean air, drinking water and land affect urban development? How can architecture and planning help take care of the existing and renovate or nurture it, the landscapes, species, etc. that are threatened with destruction or extinction?

The Peripheral Pioneers and Utopia

Many smaller towns, islands and rural areas have for decades experienced evictions following the closure of jobs, educational institutions and the decay of the building stock. The concept of ‚Äòoutlying territories has become mainstream. But in an increasingly complex and climate-apocalyptic world, more and more people are dreaming of living the good, simple and literally nourishing life in the countryside. Both in relation to being able to live more sustainably and be more in harmony with nature, be part of local communities, experience less stress and as a (re) discovery of the qualities in the countryside beyond an economic growth ideology. Many choose to do it together and several new self-sufficient housing communities are formed. With the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend seems to have gained further traction, and even more city dwellers are moving to the countryside. As Rem Koolhaas prophetically stated with his exhibition, 'Countryside, The Future', which opened just before the global closure of cities: 'The countryside is where the radical changes are.'What notions of and experiments for settlement and community do we see emerge, and what visions and concrete methods are they built on? What experiences about sustainability can be drawn from the new 'utopias' in the countryside and into urban planning? That the future is urban has been established for a long time, but what if it is also time to look at the rural in our search for sustainable coexistence between humans, species and ecosystems?",

People are at once a celebrated and reviled pastime. From humble beginnings as a vandal‚Äôs crime in New York City, street art has evolved to become globally accepted. Artists like Shepard Fairey and JR have seen their work attract attention in political campaigns and high society.

The street art initiative by Shanaya provides a safe haven for these masterfully creative works.

binary = Project.new(title: "Sketch of Binary Perception", description: "2020 was a particularly hard year for the trans and non-binary community. Not only were we struck by the morbid, isolating restrictions of lockdown, but we faced increasing global violence (particularly against trans people of colour), transphobic tirades, and the implementation of devastating policy by Liz Truss.

Now, against the advice of healthcare professionals, court orders have halted puberty blockers being given out at The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (the London-based Gender Identity Development Service), thereby restricting the access of these drugs to under-16 trans youths. Amid this backdrop of hostility, violence, prejudice, and isolation a group of artists came together during lockdown to resiliently forge a creative trans community.

Trans healthcare charity We Exist teamed up with artist studio initiative The Koppel Project to facilitate an artist residency exclusively for trans and non-binary folk. Running from November 2020 to the end of January 2021, the residency provided studio space for 30 creatives in the heart of London. The space was open to trans artists of all creative backgrounds, from dancers and designers to writers and sculptors, covering a wide diversity of gender expressions and identities.

The residency took place at the abandoned, old campus of Central Saint Martins, a building which birthed such legends as Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Kane. Taking it over in 2016 in order to provide affordable studio spaces and teaching for artists, The Koppel Project's intention is creating ‚Äùa safe, inclusive community for artistic expression and a platform for all emerging makers.‚Äù Whist adhering to social distancing, the space remained open over lockdown, giving these artists a creative haven to make, scavenge, and destroy before the campus‚Äô renovation starts this February.

In December, photographer Antonio Perricone visited the artists for a series of portraits. Being on location at the eerie old campus set the tone for the shoot. ‚ÄùWandering around this vast empty building on a weekend with very little natural light, the sense of the place‚Äôs creative history hung all around us. We were inspired in part by the scene in Fellini‚Äôs La Dolce Vita where a group of strangers walk around this huge old house together by candlelight,‚Äù Perricone tells Dazed. ‚ÄúEach photograph started with a discussion of the artist‚Äôs practice, looking through the references together, and then picking from Ellie and Eddie's wonderful wardrobe and deciding how the styling and choreography could best express the sitter‚Äôs personality ‚Äî if too much styling or posing didn't feel right we wouldn't go with it.

Additionally, the exhibition Auction 6 consciously works within the limitations determined by the current conditions of the world‚Äînamely, a global pandemic‚Äîto find new curatorial possibilities within extraordinary and challenging circumstances. This also gives us the opportunity to re-establish the gallery‚Äôs core directives: to remain a consistent and active member of the local community, while considering community health and safety. To this end, Auction 6 will assume a de-centralised format to become the second auction in which the bidding takes place online.
                        In previous auctions at Weserhalle, over 90% of the participating artists and buyers were local to Neuk√∂lln. The community-oriented programme of Weserhalle emphasises connection and conviviality, with an intention to generate community networks of artist support and neighbourhood engagement. By taking this localised approach, we aim to raise funds to enable both our gallery and the artists we support to continue producing their respective work, while also maintaining a significant connection to the surrounding neighbourhood. We intend to preserve this community building initiative as central to our curatorial programme, using the online auction format to expand the reach of the gallery for the benefit of the artists we support. Additionally, in order to make art accessible to a wide range of visitors, artworks will be priced at a scale of affordability. ")

Part auction, part online fair, the new model hopes to bring momentum to corners of the market that have been neglected during the pandemic. The platform debuted on February 23 with a live, 22-lot auction and a 49-lot timed online auction, which kicked off a week of online viewing rooms.
The hybrid format is being introduced amid a wider blurring of the boundaries between the traditional territories of galleries and auction houses, as private sales become more important for the main houses, and the demand for ultra-contemporary work continues to soar.")

We are looking for sculptors and models to pose for a series of sculptors that are going to be painted by me and photographed by Fernanda Souza, later it will be rendered in 3D (we're also looking for a person to do that.)

The concept:

Originating in philosophical and scientific writings, sensibility became an English-language literary movement, particularly in the then-new genre of the novel. Such works, called sentimental novels, featured individuals who were prone to sensibility, often weeping, fainting, feeling weak, or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience. If one were especially sensible, one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others. This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible person's ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them. However, the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash, as anti-sensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics, and such an emphasis on one's own feelings and reactions a sign of narcissism. Samuel Johnson, in his portrait of Miss Gentle, articulated this criticism:

She daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain, and another be frighted by the high wind. Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets, and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates.
Sentimentalism asserted that over-shown feeling was not a weakness but rather showed one to be a moral person. Arising from religiously motivated empathy, it expanded to the other perceptions‚Äîfor example, sensual love was no longer understood as a destructive passion (Vanitas) but rather as a basis of social institutions, as it was for Antoine Houdar de la Motte. Requited love was, as in serious opera (the Trag√©die en musique or Opera seria), a symbol for a successful alliance between nations. The 'Lesesucht' re-evaluated what was permitted literature, and the novel as a type of literature as versus drama.

Around the middle of the century, sentimentalism set 'untouched' nature against (courtly) civilization, as in the works of Jean Jacques Rousseau. In addition, Samuel Richardson's sentimental epistolary novel 'Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded' (1740) had great literary influence.

In continental Europe, one aspect of sentimentalism was Empfindsamkeit. The sensitive style (German: empfindsamer Stil) of music, developed in Germany, aimed to express 'true and natural' feelings, in contrast to the baroque.

The origin of sentimentalism in this context was chiefly religious, with the emotionally coloured texts for the oratorios of Johann Sebastian Bach stream being typical examples. Empfindsamkeit is also known as secularized pietism because it frequently came with moralizing content that had increasingly broken free of church and religious ties. An important theorist of the movement was Jean Baptiste Dubos.

                         description: "The exhibition invites 100 Berlin-based artists to come into an empty gallery space and their presence becomes part of the work. It aims to go beyond the usual bound that separates the artist and the performer from the public, and invite the public to participate in the artist‚Äôs experience and to the artist‚Äôs point of view.
                         As a response to Institut f√ºr Alles M√∂gliche, Take Place ‚Ö† fills the 20 square meter gallery space with artists. Presented through the window wall towards the street, the work consists of live encounters between people, while the material is the artists or the artists‚Äô presence. During the opening hour, street passengers and visitors are welcome to come into the gallery. Once they enter the gallery, the audiences become parts of the work. With artists standing, sitting and chatting in the space, the work erases the difference between the artists and visitors, and questions the general expectations towards an exhibition. It exists as a performance, an interaction, and an immaterial experience.
                         In Take Place ‚Ö†‚Ö†, a group of artists sit on three rows of stadium seats inside the gallery facing the window, and stare at the street through the entire opening hours. Rather than being observed, the work is observing whatever is happening outside the gallery and creating an unfamiliar situation for both the artists and the viewers. And the work itself is held in the moments of these encounters. Through these encounters, the work challenges the viewers‚Äô as well as the artists‚Äô roles and participations in a work and in an exhibition, blurring the lines between the making, presenting, and experiencing of an art piece.")
